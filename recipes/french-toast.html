    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>French toast</strong> is a common breakfast or dessert item made by frying a piece of bread soaked in an egg batter. French toast was developed as a way to use day-old stale bread. The literal translation of <i>pain perdu</i> is lost bread, referring to old or stale bread. When lacking stale bread, toasting your bread lightly will help it absorb more of the egg and milk batter.</p>
    <p>French toast is usually served with toppings similar to those used for pancakes, waffles, and toast. It can also be served as part of a fried breakfast with savory foods like sausages, tomato (or ketchup), baked beans, fried mushrooms, etc.</p>
