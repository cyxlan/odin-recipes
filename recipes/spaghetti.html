    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Most food historians agree that the union of <strong>spaghetti with meatballs</strong> is an American culinary invention with Italian roots. In the vast majority of cases, Old World-Italian cuisine calls for mixing heavy meat sauces with fettuccine and tagliatelle but not spaghetti.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Pasta</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 tbsp salt</li>
      <li>1 ½ gallons (5.76 liters) water</li>
      <li>1 pound (454 g) dry spaghetti</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Meatballs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 pounds (907 g) ground chuck</li>
      <li>2 pounds (907 g) ground pork shoulder</li>
      <li>12 oz (340 g) seasoned bread crumbs</li>
      <li>1 cup (240 ml) grated Parmesan cheese or Romano cheese</li>
      <li>¾ cup (180 ml) fresh parsley, minced</li>
      <li>4 eggs</li>
      <li>1 ½ tbsp finely-minced garlic</li>
      <li>½ tsp garlic powder</li>
      <li>½ tsp onion powder</li>
      <li>½ tsp black pepper</li>
      <li>½ tsp salt</li>
      <li>Olive oil</li>
      <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>½ tsp crushed red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, crushed or chopped</li>
      <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 cup (240 ml) beef stock</li>
      <li>28 oz (794 g) crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 handful chopped flat-leaf parsley</li>
      <li>10 leaves fresh basil, torn or thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Fill your largest pot with one and a half gallons of water along with three tablespoons of salt. Place it over high heat on the stove.</li>
      <li>Combine ground meat, bread crumbs, grated cheese, minced parsley and lightly beaten eggs (add eggs one at a time while stirring ingredients together). Sprinkle with minced garlic, two tablespoons of olive oil and seasonings. Then mix well until everything is combined.</li>
      <li>Form meat mixture into meatballs, using an ice cream scoop or your hands, pressing lightly, just enough so that meat holds together, but not so much that the meat is very compressed or the meatballs will be tough and dry.</li>
      <li>In a heavy skillet, heat olive oil over medium low heat. Add whole garlic cloves. Turn the garlic cloves to color them on all sides, then when lightly roasted, press them into the oil; as they brown, remove them.</li>
      <li>As soon as the oil is hot, add the meatballs to the skillet, leaving about one and a half inches between them so that they can be easily turned. Turn them often using a spatula or large spoon so that they don't stick. Make sure there is enough oil in the pan (about one half inch). You don't need extra virgin olive oil for this, any good quality Italian olive oil will do.</li>
      <li>When the meatballs are browned well on all sides, remove from the pan and drain on paper towels. Then add the next batch to the pan and continue until all are cooked.</li>
      <li>Add the pasta to the water now boiling in your pot and cook until <i>al dente</i>. This should take about 12 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add pepper flakes, garlic and finely chopped onion in the same oil you used to cook the meatballs. Sauté five to seven minutes, until onion bits are soft. Add beef stock, crushed tomatoes, and herbs. Bring to a simmer and cook for about 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Toss hot, drained pasta with a few ladles of the sauce. Turn meatballs in remaining sauce.</li>
      <li>Place pasta on dinner plates. Top with meatballs, sauce and extra grated cheese.</li>
    </ol>
