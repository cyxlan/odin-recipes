    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Risotto</strong> is an Italian rice dish, most popular in northern Italy. Traditionally, <i>risotto</i> is the name given to all recipes that use rice as the main component and are served as first dish in a traditional Italian lunch or dinner as usually pasta also is. When rice arrived in Italy six centuries ago from the Far East, it found an ideal place for cultivation in the Po river plain and during the Renaissance and gradually replaced rye, barley and millet for its ease of preparation and nutritious power. Its diffusion across the country gave rise to hundreds of recipes containing components of different local cultures. But the founder of all <i>risotti</i> is the Milan <i>risotto</i>, also called saffron <i>risotto.</i></p>
    <p>Generally the rice is slowly cooked in stock, but other liquids can be used. What's described here is a basic <i>risotto</i> recipe. Grated or ground Parmesan cheese is almost always sprinkled on top. It can be eaten as is, but risotto is generally enjoyed with one or two ingredients added. In Italy, <i>risotto</i> is, like pasta, usually served as first course, the second course being meat or fish.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>400 g (14 oz) risotto rice</li>
      <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 glass dry white wine</li>
      <li>25 g (1 oz) butter (a good rich butter is best)</li>
      <li>about 1 liter stock/broth (but it's a good idea to have more than you need)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Sweat the onion very gently over medium heat in some butter or olive oil, without letting it brown. This is known as a <i>soffritto</i> in Italy.</li>
      <li>Add the rice and cook until it has a transparent look (this shouldn't take long). Add some salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>Add the wine. A hot pan will cause the alcohol to evaporate more quickly (and create a nice dramatic effect), but make sure you don't burn the rice or the <i>soffritto</i>.</li>
      <li>As the wine cooks away you will see the remaining liquid getting thicker as it's absorbing the starch from the rice. When it's more or less gone, add some stock. Do not add too much stock. The rice should never be submerged in stock. Keep stirring it and keep adding more stock as it cooks away. This should take about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>Taste to see if the rice is done. The rice should be soft, but have enough bite to it to feel the individual grains of rice. The choice between a liquid <i>risotto</i> or a firmer one is a matter of personal preference. When put on a plate, it should spread out slowly. If it sits still, it needs some more stock; if there's liquid coming from the <i>risotto</i>, it needs to cook down a bit more.</li>
      <li>Let it rest for about a minute once ready.</li>
      <li>Vigorously stir in the butter in small chunks at the time, tasting to get the amount of butter right. Season with more salt and pepper to taste. This phase is called the <i>mantecatura</i>.</li>
      <li>Serve immediately.</li>
